# OpenGift 5th free hackathon

##MicroLife simulator

Hello, Opengifters! 

What about a little game development? 
Let's try to create something interesting. 

This is a basic class for a smallest life part - Cell. 
The main goals of our Cell is to eat, divide and survive.  
Create a battlefield where your cells will fight with others. 
Follow the conditions in comments.

You need to create the battlefield process visualization. 
The visualization rules is up to you.
It might be for example points on the black field. 
The most powerful cell is the most brighter the point.

Create the battle between at least two teams of cells. 
Every battle starts on the field with spaces (0) and obstacles (1).
On this field 10 cells of each team are randomizely created.
Each step of the battle calls "step" method of each cell. 
On every step cell decided if it wants to move, 
where it wants to move. 
Any cell can devour more weak neighbour cell on each step 
and also can be divided.

We will create the battle between your cell objects. 
The developer who will create the most life accommodated 
cells will win the hackathon!
